These tests depend on being able to stand up a fake SMTP server on
localhost:1025 and a fake HTTP server on localhost:8081. They also depend on
being able to run GHRH itself on localhost:8080. If any of those ports are
unavailable, these tests will not be able to run.

These tests also depend on having GHRH source in the GOPATH.

HOW TO RUN:

python -m unittest discover test/integration/
